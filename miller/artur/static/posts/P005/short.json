  "description": "Our first try on making ruby was a success. We managed to build an electric arc furnace using sand lime brick and graphite rods. Electrodes were made out of thick pencil leads which were contaminated with wax and had to be annealed to prevent them from exploding (yes, it happened). The furnace chamber was carved in the brick to make place for material and electrodes. Reagents used to fuse ruby were aluminum oxide (III) and chromium oxide (III). Ingredients were then crushed to fine powder and thoroughly mixed in ratio of 80:1. Then the mixture was put into furnace chamber and heated with electric arc to temperatures above 4000Â°C."
