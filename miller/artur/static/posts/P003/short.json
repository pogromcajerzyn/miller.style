  "description": "I recently tested effectiveness of combining two filters in purpose of creating cheap UV pass filter. I bought two UV filters ZWB1 and ZWB3, IR filter and two blue colored glass filters used in astronomy from delta and omegon. Blue filters ( #38a ) are “same ones” from different manufactures but their transmission statistics differ."
