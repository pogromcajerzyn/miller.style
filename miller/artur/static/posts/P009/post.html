      <p>Using three 4046 VCO oscillators connected in series I was able to make a very simple yet quite unpredictable mono synth. It was designed to work with guitar pedals as modulators to make sort of drone ambient music. The controls are volume, three inputs to control oscillators inputs and two capacitor switches for first VCO. Project was a successful first step in DIY synth and gave me some experience in audio electronics. First audio file below is presenting raw oscillator sounds. It may be rough but nevertheless still suspiring for that simple design. Second file is same oscillator but connected to guitar effects such as wah pedal, delay and reverb. It was recorded quite randomly and mixed from 3 separate recordings. The outcome, given the randomness of its creation, is very pleasing to ear for ambient background.</p>

      <p>This experiment is an introduction to future audio inventions and effects. I highly recommend to try it out as the result is very satisfying and educational. Keep in mind that the operating voltage for line input should be lover than 1.2V and the guitar level is much lower then that. If you don’t have guitar effects or don’t want to use them for future DIY synth use I advice setting 10V output level.</p>
