  "description": "PVD (Plasma Vapour Deposition) magnetron is a device that essentially smashes heavy gas particles on a target\n        material and causes it to spray off and adhere to a nearby surface. This process can easily cover almost\n        anything in thin metal layers! This might come in handy when imaging with my planned-to-do electron microscope\n        (it requires a conducive surface for the electrons to bounce off) and to create semi-transparent mirrors (maybe\n        even, in the future, a thin layer filters)."
