  "description": "Batteries (not alkaline) are made out of zinc outer shell, graphite core and electrolyte which is stored in a powder molybdenum(IV) oxide. Except for a electrolyte remaining substances can be easily processed at home for useful components. Firstly I removed any foil packaging and zinc off batteries, then simply removed graphite and stored powder in a separate container. Molybdenum oxide must be washed few times and dried to get rid of the electrolyte. Graphite rods are of great quality for arc furnace because of high purity but primarily they must be burned with torch to get rid of electrolyte. They also find use as electrodes in electrolysis or EMD process. Thermite can be obtained out of molybdenum oxide by simply mixing it with aluminum powder, however my trial failed. I assume it was caused by too low purity in a mix (You can also make a few chemicals out of it but most are toxic). Zinc is very useful as it can be easily melted to a cast."
