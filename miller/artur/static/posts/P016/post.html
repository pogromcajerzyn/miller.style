      <p>Most of the work on this project is unfortunately lost due to hard drive death... But here is the summary of
         what this project has been about (after over a year) :D</p>
      <p>This project is a continuation of a UV / IR imaging project. It utilises a different approach than filters. It
         uses a LED diodes as a source of decently narrowband light source (+-40nm). The benefit from this solution is
         a much (and I mean much) cheaper way to get a multi-spectral photo. Moreover, the LEDs also in some cases
         induce fluorescence which after calibration can be easily identified (the rgb response is different from
         illumination).</p>
      <p>The algorithm and images were unfortunately lost...</p>
