  "description": "In two simple processes of colloidal thermal synthesis weâ€˜ve managed to manufacture carbon quantum dots. The glow is clearly visible, color was limited to green but varies from sample to sample. The forming of CQDs is a complicated process but synthesis is trivial, it all comes down to decomposing a carbon source and recombining it as a tiny crystal. In first process we used ordinary white sugar (sucrose) and in the other one orange juice. CDs are soluble in water, bio compatible and very stable which is great start for bio experiments. Longer time of epitaxy correlated to narrower peak of emission thus more uniform size and shape of CDs."
