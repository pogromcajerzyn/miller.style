  "description": "There is a sticker on my telescope that reads: \"WARNING! Do not look at the sun with this telescope!\"\n        so naturally that's exactly what I did...  Using some DIY filter of course :) Astrophotography is not my strong-suit. That being said, I tried to capture what can be seen through my DIY sun\n        filter. My impatient attempt on sun imaging can be seen in the first picture on the left where you can admire the\n        sunspot group no. 3477. The photo was taken by Olympus M4/3 camera through a 2x barlow on an 8\" 1200mm Dobsonian.\n        The aperture was limited by the filter to 95mm. The photo appears just about third of the real resolving power\n        of human (my) eyeball due to my mad astrophotography skills (and quite noticeable high cloud coverage combined\n        with low sun elevation). The visual observation was far more rewarding. After combining the sun filter with\n        additional O-III 7nm filter the penumbral filaments were clearly\n        distinguishable, the faculae and of course the sunspots were easily identifiable. There were some limb\n        darkening but the granulation was barely noticeable (then again due to bad conditions). The eyepiece used was\n        an APM XWA 7.5mm 110Â° apparent FOV Which I highly recommend, but for sun observation I would go with the 9mm or\n        faster to fit whole sun disc in FOV."
