      <p>Whosoever lifts this hammer with the strength of one hand over his head, if he be worthy,
        shall possess the power of Thor Bjornsson. Maybe.</p>
      <p>I put an unnecessarily large amount of effort to create what is essentially a rather unpractical dumbbell.
         Cant say tho that it is not cool to work out with, which is sort of the point :D</p>
      <p>The handle is 50mm in diameter and the whole hammer weights just about 35kg. Due to very wide grip this weight
         is already a challenge to maneuver. The materials used are 6mm steel plates and a pipe welded together and
         filled with lead.</p>

      <p>The project is not over yet and will be continued :) the update will include a stylish hammer hanger and
         a lot of etched ornaments. See you in next update!</p>
