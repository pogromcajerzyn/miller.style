  "description": "Electret is by analogy a permanent magnet but with electric field instead of magnetic field. Its widest use is in electret microphones or as a source of a static field for dust collection or ion detection. In great simplification, an electret is a dielectric body with a charge or dipole moment frozen inside in a way that creates a permanent external electric field. There are many ways to obtain an electret, such as: photo and radioelectric, implanted charge, magnetoelectric, mechanoelectricâ€¦ However, the easiest one to execute is the thermoelectric method, which relays only on temperature and voltage delivered to the sample. In the simplest setup, we need a dielectric stacked between two HV plates and placed in an oven. Such setup is shown below."
