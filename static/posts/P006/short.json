  "description": "Slowly but consistently our reactor is being upgraded with new features. In comparison to our first prototype this one has see-through glass cylinder allowing to view the reaction from different angles. For now, it still uses the same voltage source. Vacuum problem has been solved but we’re still waiting for second diffusion pump to be repaired. After that we can achieve even lower level of pressure than ever before, which will result in higher “contrast” in potential well. Current vacuum level is around 0.2 [mbar]. "
