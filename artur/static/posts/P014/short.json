  "description": "There is a few things better than shanties around a campfire after another day of sailing adventures. Guitar accompanying the singing makes the experience  delightful. So how about stepping up the game by introducing an electric guitar into the equation? The only thing holding us back is lack of power and space taken by the guitar amplifier. Surely sounds like a nice excuse for me to renew my old electric guitar and convert it to an electronic guitar with a built-in amp and battery."
