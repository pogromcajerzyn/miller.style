      <p>From when I was a little kid I always wanted to take x-ray pictures. Now I have a way to realise this dream.
        As a first step
        I bought an RTG cassette with intensifying screen inside. To check if what I was looking at really was an
        intensifying screen I had to test it somehow. I came up with fun way to do this :). I placed the americium
        extracted from a smoke alarm on saied screen with a vase made out of uranium glass. The glass was way to week to
        produce visible response on the screen however the americium showed a clear response!</p>
      <img src="americium.jpg">
      <p>These photos show a stack of 3 photos with 7 min exposure (left) and one with a reference light photo (right).
      This clearly shows the color of the intensifying screen and confirm that it works :)</p>

      <p>How it sounds under a Geiger Miller counter (I turned on a power supply for ambient):</p>

      <p>Note that americium is only 2mm diameter thin coated disc D:</p>
