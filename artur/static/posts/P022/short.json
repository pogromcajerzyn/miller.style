  "description": "From when I was a little kid I always wanted to take x-ray pictures. Now I have a way to realise this dream. As a first step\n        I bought an RTG cassette with intensifying screen inside. To check if what I was looking at really was an\n        intensifying screen I had to test it somehow. I came up with fun way to do this :). I placed the americium\n        extracted from a smoke alarm on saied screen with a vase made out of uranium glass. The glass was way to week to\n        produce visible response on the screen however the americium showed a clear response!"
