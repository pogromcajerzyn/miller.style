  "description": "Producing energy poses a problem when it comes to pollution of environment. We use fossil fuels adding to our carbon footprint and degrading environment. The solution is seemingly trivial – turn fossil powered cars to electric ones and old coal plants to solar. But electric cars must get their power somewhere and solar plants are unefficient, expensive and not reliable. But lets take a look at our energy sources starting with fossil fuels. They are outcome of decomposition of organic mater and we know that most life is dependent on light. Then we have wind and solar power which takes its energy indirectly from our Sun. So it seems the Sun is our only source of energy. But how does the Sun produce this energy? Well, it’s by nuclear fusion. It uses hydrogen as a fuel to generate helium and in effect gives away tons of electromagnetic radiation which we use as a source of our energy."
